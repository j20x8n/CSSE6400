Course Description: Software systems are often composed of a heterogeneous network of inter-related systems. In this course you will build upon the knowledge and skills you have developed so far to learn how to design complex systems. This will include how these systems communicate and coordinate their responsibilities. You will learn design techniques to manage the complexity of large systems. You will learn how to assess and manage software risks (e.g.security, scalability, availability, resilience, robustness). You will apply these techniques to build a system composed of heterogeneous computing devices (e.g. mobile devices, servers, cloud-hosted services). You will learn how to apply systems thinking to design large-scale cyber-physical systems.
Assumed Background: 
You are assumed to have a strong background in software development. You are expected to have worked on at least one substantial software project, involving a team of members and thousands of lines of code. You should be able to design a software application consisting of several interoperating classes.
1.2 Course Introduction 
Large software systems are composed of interacting components. This is the case even if the system is only a single executable running on one computer. More sophisticated systems take advantage of the ability to distribute processing behaviour across hardware optimised for different parts of the system. In this course you will learn how to design "in the large". You will learn how to design components and their interfaces so that you can build complex systems. You will learn how to choose appropriate architectual patterns to structure systems that meet both functional and non-functional requirements of a system.
You can view this course as a capstone of your   program. It integrates and extends the knowledge and skills you have developed so far.
Course Changes in Response to Previous Student Feedback 
Assessment has been redesigned based on feedback and observation of student engagement with the course. The cloud infrastructure assignment has been staged to make progressive development towards the final solution easier.
Practical work has been turned into a streamed example of building a cloud-based application.
Course material has been updated to provide better coverage of some topics.
2.1 Course Aims 
Upon successful completion of this course you will be able design complex software systems. You will understand how different architectural patterns support delivery of different design goals, and how to choose a pattern that is appropriate in your system's context. You will be able to evaluate the architecture of an existing system to assess how well it achieves its design goals. You will know how to apply security principles to deliver secure systems.
2.2 Learning Objectives 
After successfully completing this course you should be able to:
1 Design and build a software system that delivers specifi ed functional and non-functional requirements (e.g. security, scalability, reliability, ...) by evaluating and selecting an appropriate architectural pattern and designing the components, interfaces and communication protocols to work within the pattern's structure.
2 Apply systems thinking within a team, debating and negotiating options, to design an architecturally complex software system that delivers a coherent set of functional and non-functional requirements.
3 Evaluate security risks for a software system architecture and implement security principles to minimise those risks.
4 Select an appropriate suite of tools to facilitate the delivery of a large, complex software system.
5 Describe and critique the architecture of a software system.

5.2 Course Grading 
Example criteria for each of the grades can be found in PPL 3.10.02 Assessment Procedures (https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.10.02-assessment#Procedures) - section 7 Appendix.
Grade X: No assessable work received.
Grade 1, Low Fail: Absence of evidence of achievement of course learning outcomes:
To achieve a final grade of 1, the result of the formula in the Other Requirements  Comments section is 1.
Grade 2, Fail: Minimal evidence of achievement of course learning outcomes:
To achieve a final grade of 2, the result of the formula in the Other Requirements  Comments section is 2.
Grade 3, Marginal Fail: Demonstrated evidence of developing achievement of course learning outcomes:
To achieve a final grade of 3, the result of the formula in the Other Requirements  Comments section is 3.
AND
Presentation Result >= 3
Grade 4, Pass: Demonstrated evidence of functional achievement of course learning outcomes:
To achieve a final grade of 4, the result of the formula in the Other Requirements  Comments section is 4.
AND
Presentation Result >= 4
Grade 5, Credit: Demonstrated evidence of profi cient achievement of course learning outcomes:
To achieve a final grade of 5, the result of the formula in the Other Requirements  Comments section is 5.
AND
Presentation Result >= 5
Grade 6, Distinction: Demonstrated evidence of advanced achievement of course learning outcomes:
To achieve a final grade of 6, the result of the formula in the Other Requirements  Comments section is 6.
AND
Presentation Result >= 5
Grade 7, High Distinction: Demonstrated evidence of exceptional achievement of course learning outcomes:
To achieve a final grade of 7, the result of the formula in the Other Requirements  Comments section is 7.
AND
Presentation Result >= 5
Other Requirements  Comments:
Your final grade is determined by the following formula.
Final Grade = ROUND(Case Study Presentation Grade   ×   30% + Project Proposal Grade   ×   5% + Cloud Infrastructure Assignment   ×   30% + Delivering Quality Attributes Project   ×   35%)
In the formula above, your final grade is rounded to the nearest integer (e.g. 4.45 is rounded to a grade of 4, 4.5 is rounded to a grade of 5).
The presentation is an identity verifi ed assessment activity. In order to obtain a final grade greater than
2, your presentation result must be at least 3.
3, your presentation result must be at least 4.
4, your presentation result must be at least 5.
Your presentation result is what you obtain for the presentation, before any penalty is applied to your presentation grade.
The course coordinator reserves the right to moderate results.
5.3 Late Submission 
The submission of assessment material by the due date and time set out in this Electronic Course Profi le is the sole responsibility of the student. Students should not leave assignment preparation until the last minute and must plan their workloads to meet published deadlines. It is your responsibility to manage your time effectively and to commence submission/upload processes well in advance of the deadline to ensure submission is completed before the deadline. Please be aware that in the case of progressive assessment, extensions may not be possible or may be capped in duration where that assessment occurs in scheduled class-based activities with immediate feedback or due to the planned release of solutions/feedback. This ensures that extensions are approved in a timescale that is not unfair to other students in the course as per   UQ Assessment
PPL, section 3.3.1-3.3.3 (https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.10.02-assessment). An extension will not be granted beyond the time that the assessment task has been graded and feedback is scheduled to be provided to the rest of the cohort.
All assessment items in this course must be submitted on or before the due date specifi ed in this course profi le. Late submissions of assessment items will only be accepted if approval for late submission has been obtained prior to the due date. Guidelines for late submission are available here (https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension). Individuals working in the engineering, architecture, computing, IT and design sectors are often required to work progressively and iterate on their work to meet deadlines.
For this reason, some items in School of EECS courses may have ADA approval for an alternative late penalty. You must familiarise yourself with the per-assessment late penalty specifi ed in this course profi le.
If there are documented exceptional circumstances (https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-extension)   that affect your ability to complete an assessment task by the due date you may apply for an extension, exemption or deferral. These will only be granted with appropriate supporting documentary evidence (e.g. offi cial medical certifi cate), and will only be approved within a timescale that is not unfair to other students enrolled in the course as per   UQ Assessment Procedure (https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.10.02-assessment#Procedures). All extensions (and where applicable exemptions) must be requested via   my.UQ(https://my.uq.edu.au/). UQ policy provides in-semester extensions can be capped to 4 weeks, however you must familarise yourself with the maximum permitted extension for the relevant assessment item in this course profi le. All progressive assessment tasks in the School of EECS have ADA approved maximum permitted durations to allow for timely course wide release of feedback and/or solutions and/or code for progressive assessment items.
Instructions for how to formally submit extension requests is available   here (https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-assessment-extension). Extensions are granted in multiples of 24 hours, i.e., the due time will be same as for the original deadline. In exceptional circumstances, if an extension cannot be granted then the course coordinator may grant an exemption from the item. If an exemption is approved, the course coordinator may make alternative arrangements, set an alternate item, and/or reweight other assessment items if appropriate. Extension requests sent directly to Course Coordinators in the School of EECS will not be considered.
Extensions granted for an assessment item cannot be used to justify a subsequent extension request for a later item. Extensions are not a remedy for students experiencing more signifi cant interruptions to study. If you are experiencing signifi cant diffi culties then you should seek advice from UQ Student Services (https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/student-support/student-advice-welfare), the EAIT Faculty office(https://www.eait.uq.edu.au/contact), or EECS Coursework Studies offi ce (https://itee.uq.edu.au/contact).
Assessment Items Due at a Certain Time (including class-based Quizzes, Oral Presentations, or assessed Laboratory Practicals):
Late penalties per assessment item on this course and extensions possible are specifi ed in the table below and may vary between assessment types. You must check this for each relevant assessment item listed below. Please keep a record of your submission time.
